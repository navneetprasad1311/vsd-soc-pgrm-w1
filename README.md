## Day-Wise Folder Simulation

1. Navigate to `Day X` folder.
2. Compile RTL or netlist using `iverilog`.
3. Simulate using `vvp` and open waveforms with GTKWave.
4. Follow snapshots in the README for expected results.

---

## Summary
- **Day 1**: Covers the basics of Verilog *RTL design and synthesis*, introducing how RTL descriptions are mapped to hardware.

- **Day 2**: Focuses on *timing libraries*, *hierarchical* vs *flat synthesis* approaches, and efficient coding styles for flip-flops.

- **Day 3**: Explains combinational and sequential *optimizations in synthesis* to improve *logic* and *efficiency*.

- **Day 4**: Discusses *Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)*, the differences between *blocking and non-blocking assignments*, and *synthesis-simulation mismatches*.

- **Day 5**: Explores optimization in synthesis, covering *conditional constructs* (if-else, case), *inferred latches*, *partial assignments*, *loops*, and *generate constructs*.

## Notes
- **File Organization:** All synthesized netlists and compiled Verilog files are stored in the `~/Documents/Verilog/Labs` folder for easy access and reference.  
- **Snapshots & Documentation:** All simulation waveforms, netlist snapshots, and related screenshots are unique and original.
